A new feature by CSIS’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative uses satellite imagery to document renewed illegal Chinese clam harvesting in the South China Sea. The practice has damaged at least 25,000 acres of reef, further endangering a critical ecosystem in a region already faced with collapsing fish stocks.  Clam harvesting also serves as an additional example of the Chinese using resource exploitation as a means of supporting its illegal territorial claims in the region and will increase tensions between China and the Philippines.
