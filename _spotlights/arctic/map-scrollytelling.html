      ------ Animate the line each month over the course of 2018, to establish the growth/receding that takes place in a year<br /><br />
      Both newer and thinner (young) ice as well as thicker, multi-year (old) ice grows and diminishes, extending to a maximum in the fall and winter months before slowly receding as temperatures warm in the spring and summer (its minimum).

      ------ Animate the line to the 2018 maximum & Add a second line to show median maximum for the past 40 years to show comparison (1981-2010 median extent line).<br /><br />
      For nearly 40 years, scientists have monitored this ebb and flow. In 2018, Arctic sea ice extent reached its <a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2018/03/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-second-lowest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximum at 5.59 million square miles</a>, which is the second lowest ever recorded confirming that the Arctic continues to melt on an annual basis and at a record pace.

      ------ Add the additional 3 lines of seasonal maxima for 2017, 2016, 2015<br /><br />
      The <a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2018/03/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-second-lowest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four lowest seasonal maxima</a> have all occurred during the last four years.

      ------ Animate the line to the 2018 minimum and show the 1981-2010 median extent line to show comparison<br /><br />
      Record findings are also being reported for summer sea ice extent. This past September, sea ice extent reached an <a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2017/09/arctic-sea-ice-at-minimum-extent-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual minimum of 1.77 million square miles</a>, 629,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 median extent. It is the sixth lowest retreat since monitoring began.
