      Both newer and thinner (young) ice as well as thicker, multi-year (old) ice grows and diminishes, extending to a maximum in the fall and winter months before slowly receding as temperatures warm in the spring and summer (its minimum).

      <p>For nearly 40 years, scientists have monitored this ebb and flow.</p>

      The <a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2018/03/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-second-lowest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four lowest seasonal maxima</a> have all occurred during the last four years.

      Record findings are also being reported for summer sea ice extent. This past September, sea ice extent reached an <a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2017/09/arctic-sea-ice-at-minimum-extent-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual minimum of 1.77 million square miles</a>, 629,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 median extent. It is the sixth lowest retreat since monitoring began.
