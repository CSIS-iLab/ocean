Welcome to new and largely uncharted maritime space: the Arctic Ocean. Only 2 percent of its waters are charted to international standards, but what is truly unchartered is its rapid transformation. The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet and has been warmer over the past five years than at any time since records began in 1900.[^1] A warming Arctic is now home to a substantially diminished Greenland ice sheet and polar ice cap, ocean acidification, algae blooms, and dramatic changes to sensitive Arctic ecosystems crucial to sustaining sea life.

------ START background image scrolling // map of the Arctic, with a line drawn for the ice extend in January 2018

Of course, one of the most distinctive features of the Arctic is its sea ice.

------ Animate the line each month over the course of 2018, to establish the growth/receding that takes place in a year

Both newer and thinner (young) ice as well as thicker, multi-year (old) ice grows and diminishes, extending to a maximum in the fall and winter months before slowly receding as temperatures warm in the spring and summer (its minimum).

------ Animate the line to the 2018 maximum.

For nearly 40 years, scientists have monitored this ebb and flow.

------ Add a second line to show median maximum for the past 40 years to show comparison (1981-2010 median extent line)

In 2018, Arctic sea ice extent reached its [maximum at 5.59 million square miles](https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2018/03/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-second-lowest/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, which is the second lowest ever recorded confirming that the Arctic continues to melt on an annual basis and at a record pace.

------ Add the additional 3 lines of seasonal maxima for 2017, 2016, 2015

[The four lowest seasonal maxima](https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2018/03/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-second-lowest/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} have all occurred during the last four years.

------ Animate the line to the 2018 minimum and show the 1981-2010 median extent line to show comparison

Record findings are also being reported for summer sea ice extent. This past September, sea ice extent reached an [annual minimum of 1.77 million square miles](https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2017/09/arctic-sea-ice-at-minimum-extent-2/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, 629,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 median extent. It is the sixth lowest retreat since monitoring began.

## Governing an Unchartered Ocean

How do nations effectively govern this rapidly changing ocean? Since 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has governed the international maritime environment. UNCLOS created obligations for safeguarding the marine environment, established norms for activity on the high seas, and founded a legal regime for regulating mineral resource exploitation in deep seabed areas beyond national jurisdiction.

UNCLOS outlined norms for both {% include sc-tooltip.html title="territorial waters" description="Territorial waters is a maritime zone extending a single state’s sovereign territory up to 12 nautical miles (22km) off their coast. The state has full jurisdiction over nearly all (including foreign) activities on the water, as well as the seabed, subsoil, and airspace." %} and {% include sc-tooltip.html title="exclusive economic zones" description="An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is adjacent to a state’s territorial waters and extends up to 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) off a country’s coast. The state has exclusive rights for exploration and exploitation of marine resources in this zone and exercises jurisdiction over marine research and conservation. Foreign vessels (and aircraft) can operate freely through this zone as long as they do not infringe upon the coastal state’s economic rights." %} (EEZs) and included provisions to extend a nation’s outer continental shelf. UNCLOS even provided special regulations for human activities in ice-covered waters (Article 234). One hundred sixty-eight parties have ratified the treaty but notably missing from the list is the United States, which views UNCLOS as customary international law.

{% _explainer title="Polar Code" align="right" %}
<p><a href="http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/polar/Documents/POLAR%20CODE%20TEXT%20AS%20ADOPTED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Polar Code</a> has been developed to supplement existing IMO instruments to increase the safety of ships’ operation and mitigate the impact on the people and environment in the remote, vulnerable, and potentially harsh polar waters. It covers the <a href="http://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/hottopics/polar/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full range of shipping-related matters</a> relevant to navigation in water surrounding the two poles – ship design, construction and equipment; operational and training concerns; search and rescue; and, equally important, the protection of the unique environment and eco-systems of the polar regions.</p>
{% end_explainer %}

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) also helps govern the maritime environment and in 2014 approved a mandatory Polar Code which sets mandatory standards for ships operating in the polar regions. In force since January 2017, the Polar Code Regulations seek to protect Arctic waters by promoting enhanced safety and environmental standards in Arctic waters through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at SEA ([SOLAS](<http://www.imo.org/en/About/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-for-the-safety-of-life-at-sea-(solas),-1974.aspx>){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}) and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships [MARPOL](<http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-for-the-prevention-of-pollution-from-ships-(marpol).aspx>){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}).

SOLAS specifies minimum standards for the construction, equipment, and operation of ships at sea, while MARPOL addresses pollution prevention in sensitive marine environments and includes regulations controlling toxic discharges from ships. Amendments have been added to both conventions in recent years to further enhance safety for both seafarers and passengers in an unpredictable environment.[^2]

Most recently, IMO member states renewed efforts to ban the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) in the Arctic.[^3] States including Finland, Germany, Iceland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United States have called for a full HFO prohibition on a rapid timetable. One of the dirtiest fossil fuels, HFOs and the impact of soot emissions accelerate sea ice melt and threaten fragile Arctic ecosystems.

At the regional level, the Arctic Council was formed in 1996 as an intergovernmental forum that brings the five Arctic coastal nations together with Arctic nations, and Arctic indigenous communities (called the Permanent Participants) to protect the Arctic environment and support sustainable development.

Some of the Council’s most effective bodies are its working groups. The Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) Working Group has produced ground-breaking assessments such as the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment (AMSA), which led to the creation of the Polar Code. The working group also proposed, in 2015, a framework to preserve Arctic waters through a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) across the circumpolar Arctic.

---------STATIC IMAGE MPAs Map

The rapid loss of sea ice and changes in ocean chemistry increasingly threatens sensitive ecosystems and Arctic biodiversity. Since Arctic life does not recognize international borders, an international network of MPAs across the Arctic would protect marine biodiversity, preserve cultural heritage and subsistence resources, and strengthen marine ecosystem resilience that ultimately underpins human well-being.[^4]

{% include sc-blockquote.html content="Arctic life does not recognize international borders" %}

Unfortunately, countries have only embraced national MPAs rather than an integrated approach. An estimated [11.4 percent of the Arctic, or about 3.7 million square kilometers](https://www.pame.is/images/03_Projects/MPA/Indicator/Indicator_Report_on_Protected_Areas_.pdf){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, is currently under protected status. Within U.S. waters, federally protected waters include the Arctic Management Area encompassing the Chukchi and Beaufort
Seas and the Northern Bering Sea Research Area, just south of the Arctic Circle and the Bering Strait.

## Charting the Future of Arctic Biodiversity

Arctic and non-Arctic states are beginning to creatively charter new norms and regulations for managing Arctic biodiversity, namely valuable fishing stocks. The most notable example is the 2017 Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean. The five Arctic coastal states, led by the United States and Russia, negotiated the outlines of the precautionary fisheries agreement in 2015 before inviting four states—China (the largest fishing nation), Japan, South Korea, Iceland, along with the European Union—that have significant fishing interest in the region, to join the negotiating framework.

Despite there being no known fishing stocks in this area, the agreement creates a Joint Program of Scientific Research and Monitoring, which seeks to develop a greater scientific understanding of the Arctic marine ecosystem in the Central Arctic Ocean. Also known as the “5+5 fisheries agreement,” it places a moratorium on fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean, 40 percent of which is currently open water.[^5] The moratorium would last for 16 years while scientific research is conducted to better understand whether future fish stocks could be harvested on a sustainable basis. The agreement protects 2.8 million square kilometers of international waters in the Arctic.

Another important new area is scientifically-based marine conservation provisions for Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). [ABNJ](https://www.thegef.org/topics/areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} refers to “the high seas” or those areas of the ocean where no one nation has sole responsibility for management. ABNJs do not fall under any one nation’s jurisdiction.

----- STATIC IMAGE Map showing territorial waters, EEZs, & ABNJ

ABNJ make up approximately [40 percent](https://www.thegef.org/topics/areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} of the surface of the planet, comprising [64 percent](https://www.thegef.org/topics/areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} of the surface of the oceans and nearly [95 percent](https://www.thegef.org/topics/areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} of its volume. These waters represent the largest and most diverse cache of biodiversity on earth. These vital living resources are collectively referred to as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ).

{% include sc-statistic.html align='right' number='40%' pre="The ‘high seas’ make up approximately" post='of the surface of the planet
' %}

The high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean might prove to be the most contentious region in the current BBNJ debate. Its marine area totals some 14 million square kilometers, of which 2.8 million square kilometers are the high seas. It is also home to some of the most unique and fragile ecosystems on earth. Around 21,000 species inhabit the Arctic Ocean, including 5,000 animal species such as marine mammals, birds, fish, and other higher organisms; 2,000 types of algae; and tens of thousands of ecologically critical microbes.[^6]

In July 2017, the United Nations agreed that negotiations for an international legally binding instrument on BBNJ (under UNCLOS) should move forward.[^7] The first session to discuss this instrument occurred in September 2018 where positions were put forward and elements of a working draft were discussed.

If the United Nations is successful in its efforts to ensure biodiversity in the high seas area of the Central Arctic Ocean for future generations, it will chart a new course for a new ocean.
