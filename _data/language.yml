  about_title: About this project
  about_desc_one: The Stephenson Ocean Security (SOS) Project examines the intersection
    of ocean health and global security. It proposes policy solutions that support
    sustainable development and reduce conflict.
  about_desc_two: This project focuses on the ways ecological and socioeconomic changes
    interact to drive competition for marine resources and how such competition contributes
    to instability and geopolitical risk. Proposed policy solutions emphasize the
    ways effective ocean governance can moderate these risks and increase the resilience
    of both ecosystems and states against the destabilizing forces of change.
  spotlights_title: Spotlights
  spotlights_desc: SOS Spotlight projects provide in depth analysis and novel research
    on regionally specific marine resource and security challenges. These deep dives
    are meant to examine particularly complex issues and advance the global dialog
    towards solutions.
