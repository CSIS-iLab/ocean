The Stephenson Ocean Security Project launched Wednesday, January 9, 2019.

The Stephenson Ocean Security Project (SOS) is focused on the links between ocean health and global security. The Project highlights how marine resource disputes drive instability in key regions of the globe and the ways that climate change is exacerbating this challenge through degraded ecosystems and the opening of new areas to potential exploitation.

The SOS Project is committed to promoting solutions that support sustainable development, coalition building, and the need for American leadership.
