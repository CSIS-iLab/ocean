The Stephenson Ocean Security Project launched Wednesday, January 9, 2019.  
  
The Stephenson Ocean Security Project (SOS) is focused on the links between ocean health and global security. The Project highlights how marine resource disputes drive instability in key regions of the globe and the ways that climate change is exacerbating this challenge through degraded ecosystems and the opening of new areas to potential exploitation.

The SOS Project is committed to promoting solutions that support sustainable development, coalition building, and the need for American leadership.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) provided keynote remarks.

Dr. John Hamre President and CEO (CSIS), Phil Stephenson Founder (The Philip Stephenson Foundation), and Dr. Whit Saumweber Director (Stephenson Ocean Security Project, CSIS) provided opening remarks.

The event also featured expert panels that explored the intersection of fisheries and security risk in the South China Sea and the challenge and opportunity presented by marine resources in the new Arctic Ocean.
